# Safari Animal Guessing Game
## Project Overview
The Safari Animal Guessing Game is a full-stack web application designed to entertain users with a fun and interactive animal guessing game. Leveraging the power of Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, this project demonstrates a seamless integration of technologies to deliver a smooth and engaging user experience.

## Technologies Used
Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

Backend: Flask, Python

Web Server: Waitress

CORS Handling: Flask-CORS

Deployment: Render

Authentication: Firebase Authentication

Key Features

Interactive Gameplay: Users can start a new game, make guesses, and receive real-time feedback on their inputs.

Dynamic Hints: The application provides hints based on user guesses to help them figure out the correct animal.

Responsive Design: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Properly configured to allow secure interactions between the frontend hosted on a different domain and the backend server.

User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely using Firebase Authentication.

## Project Structure

### Backend

app.py: Contains the Flask application setup, game logic, and API endpoints.

main.py: Entry point for running the Flask app using the Waitress web server.

requirements.txt: Lists all the dependencies required for the project.

### Frontend

static/index.html: The main HTML file serving the React app.

static/index.css: General styling for the application.

static/WordGame.css: Specific styles for the WordGame component.

static/WordGame.js: Contains the React component responsible for the gameâ€™s logic and UI.

Components/SignUp.js: React component for user sign-up.

Components/SignIn.js: React component for user sign-in.

Components/Navbar.js: React component for the navigation bar, including logout functionality.

## Project Workflow

Start a New Game: Users initiate a new game by making a GET request to the /app/start_game endpoint. The backend selects a random animal from a predefined list and returns the word length and the number of turns allowed.

Make a Guess: Users input their guess, which is sent as a POST request to the /app/make_guess endpoint. The backend processes the guess, updates the game state, and returns feedback including hints and the number of turns remaining.

Real-Time Feedback: The frontend dynamically updates to show the user's progress, including correct guesses, incorrect guesses, and hints to aid in guessing the correct animal.

## Authentication Workflow

User Sign-Up: Users create an account by providing their email and password. The sign-up form sends a POST request to Firebase Authentication, and upon successful registration, users are redirected to the game screen.

User Sign-In: Users log in by providing their email and password. The sign-in form sends a POST request to Firebase Authentication, and upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the game screen.

User Logout: Users can log out by clicking the logout button in the navigation bar, which triggers a Firebase sign-out operation and redirects users to the sign-in screen.

## Challenges and Solutions

CORS Configuration: Ensuring that the frontend and backend could communicate securely required proper CORS setup in Flask. This was achieved using Flask-CORS to handle cross-origin requests.

Responsive Design: Crafting a responsive and visually appealing UI involved using CSS media queries and flexible layouts to adapt to different screen sizes.

User Authentication: Implementing secure user authentication using Firebase Authentication and ensuring proper session management.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Render, ensuring a reliable and scalable environment to handle user requests efficiently. The backend is served using Waitress, a production-ready WSGI server for Python web applications.

## Conclusion
The Safari Animal Guessing Game project showcases the integration of Flask and React to create a seamless and engaging user experience. The addition of Firebase Authentication ensures secure user management, enhancing the overall functionality and security of the application.
